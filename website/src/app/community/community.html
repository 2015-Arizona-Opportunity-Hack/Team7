      <h2>Community Action Program</h2>

      <p>It is an unfortunate reality that many people will be in need of emergency assistance at some time in their
        lives. The sudden loss of a job, a catastrophic event or illness, even extreme weather can create unmanageable
        burdens for anyone. Our CAP programs offer a balanced approach to meet the needs of our community.</p>
