      <h2>Food Bank</h2>

      <p>Each year CCCC distributes over 15,000 food boxes with enough food to feed over 50,000 adults and children. Persons needing emergency food are referred by a variety of agencies but primarily by the CAP (Community Action Program) office.  Other referrals come from Child Protective Services, non-profits, churches, schools, the Chandler Police Department's Victim Services and the Chandler Fire Department.</p>
