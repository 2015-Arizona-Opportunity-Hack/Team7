      <h2>Senior Centers</h2>

      <p>Our Senior Centers provide hours of camaraderie, intellectual stimulation and nutritious meals to the frail, elderly, and disabled in our communities.  In addition to serving a hot meal, both centers offer an array of activities, outings, workshops, classes, medical programs, transportation, referrals, and volunteer opportunities.  We operate the local senior center for the Town of Gilbert and the senior meals program in the City of Chandler.</p>
