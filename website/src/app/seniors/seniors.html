      <h2>Senior Centers</h2>

      <p>Our Senior Centers provide hours of camaraderie, intellectual stimulation and nutritious meals to the frail,
        elderly, and disabled in our communities. In addition to serving a hot meal, both centers offer an array of
        activities, outings, workshops, classes, medical programs, transportation, referrals, and volunteer
        opportunities. We operate the local senior center for the Town of Gilbert and the senior meals program in the
        City of Chandler.</p>
