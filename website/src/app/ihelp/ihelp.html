      <h2>I-Help</h2>

      <p>Chandler Christian Community Center (CCCC) offers the only homeless shelter in the City of Chandler, the
        Interfaith Homeless Emergency Lodging Program (I-HELP). In partnership with faith-based organizations and
        community agencies in Chandler, Gilbert, and Tempe, Chandler I-HELP provides a safe place to sleep and a hot
        meal for homeless adults 7 nights per week, 365 days per year.</p>

      <p>I-HELP also offers case management services to connect homeless individuals to the vital resources needed to
        regain self-sufficiency and break the vicious cycle of homelessness. Through our mobile shower unit, the
        “Chandler Clean Machine,” I-HELP provides guests with ready access to showers, an invaluable tool in gaining and
        maintaining employment.</p>
