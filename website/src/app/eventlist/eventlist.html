        [img]<br/>
        Operation Santa provides toys and gifts to children in need in our community. In addition, the Adopt-a-Family
        program matches donor groups with families in need to provide gifts such as toys or clothes for the children,
        basic household items for the family, grocery gift cards, or food for a holiday meal. In 2012, our program
        expanded to include children in the Gilbert community, as well as Chandler, which meant more children. In 2013
        we served over 2000 children, yet we work collaboratively with other organizations to cross-check the names of
        all individuals registered to eliminate duplication of services, which allows us to reach more children.<br/>
        <br/>

        In 2013, a pilot program has been introduced to provide an opportunity for parents to become more involved in
        providing Christmas for their children by attending classes or volunteering to earn points towards higher end
        gifts, such as bikes. We are well aware that many parents yearn to provide gifts for their children, yet their
        current circumstances limit them from doing so. This program provides this empowerment to these parents. Help us
        support these parents who make the effort by attending classes and volunteering, by supporting this portion of
        our Operation Santa program.<br/>
        <br/>

        There are several ways that you can help to bring smiles to these families. Help us by bringing in new toys or
        gift cards to the CCCC office, hosting a toy drive, adopting one or more families (individually or through your
        organization), shop for particular children, or make a monetary donation.
